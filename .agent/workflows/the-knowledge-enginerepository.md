# The Knowledge Engine(Repository

Discovery)
← Back to Index

Role:All Engineers & ScientistsGoal:Rapidly navigatethe sprawling 74+ repository landscape
 without "Slack and pray."


The Context: "Where does this code live?"
Onboarding at Tempus is notoriously difficult. With74 separate repositoriesgoverning
 everything from RNA pre-processing to cluster deployment, finding the "Source of Truth" is a
  forensic exercise.


🛑 The Old Way


    ● Keyword Hunting:Grepping through GitHub Org for "transformer."(Returns 100+
           matches).
     ● Documentation Archaeology:Reading 3-year-old READMEsin `molecular-models` that
            reference deprecated buckets.
      ● Tribal Knowledge:Asking in `#platform-support`:"Doesanyone know where the VEP runner
             config logic lives?"and waiting 4 hours for a reply.


👾 The GREMLIN Way


GREMLIN has indexed theentire codebase(Code + Docs)into its vector store. It acts as a
 semantic search engine across the engineering organization.

Command:Ask natural language questions about thecode.Action:GREMLIN retrieves the
 relevant files, summarizes the architecture, and points to the exact lines of code.




Example 1: Finding Logic in the Haystack
Context:A scientist wants to understand how RNA transcriptsare tokenized for the BERT model,
 but doesn't know which of the 5 RNA repos holds the logic.

gremlin > Where is the tokenizer logic for the RNA BERT model?

[LOG] Searching Knowledge Base (Scopes: molecular-models, unimodal-rna-model)...




ANSWER:


The RNA tokenizer logic is located in `unimodal-rna-model`.




Key File: `unimodal_rna_model/data/tokenizer.py`


Class: `GeneTokenizer`




How it works:


1. It uses a fixed vocabulary of 20,061 HGNC gene symbols.


2. It maps genes to integers `[1, 20061]`.


3. Special tokens: `[PAD]=0`, `[CLS]=20062`, `[MASK]=20063`.




Reference:


> It does NOT use BPE (Byte Pair Encoding). It is a "Gene-level" vocabulary.


> See: `unimodal_rna_model/README.md` generic section.




Would you like to see the `GeneTokenizer.encode()` method? [Y/n]





Example 2: "How do I?" for Infrastructure
Context:A new engineer needs to deploy a Neo4j databasebut has never used the internal helm
 charts.

gremlin > How do I deploy a Neo4j instance to the dev cluster?




[LOG] Searching Knowledge Base (Scopes: neo4j-deploy, sre, cookbooks)...




ANSWER:


You should use the `neo4j-deploy` repository.




Steps:


1. Clone `neo4j-deploy`.

2. Copy `values-template.yaml` to `values-dev.yaml`.


3. Run the deployment script found in `sre/scripts/deploy_neo4j.sh`.




Required Configs:


- `storage_class`: Must be set to `pd-ssd` for performance.


- `namespace`: Use `neo4j-dev`.




Command to run:





./sre/scripts/deploy_neo4j.sh --env dev --config values-dev.yaml



⚠️ Warning: Do not deploy to `prod` without approval from the Platform Team (repo

`tempathy-ofmarshal` governs access).





Example 3: Debugging Legacy Artifacts
Context:A pipeline fails because an old model checkpointis missing.

gremlin > specific error: "Artifact rn_v2_base not found in registry." Where was this

defined?




[LOG] Searching Knowledge Base for 'rn_v2_base'...




ANSWER:


I found references to `rn_v2_base` in `ofm-baselines/legacy_manifest.json`.




History:


- It was trained in Q3 2023.


- It was Deprecated in Q1 2024 in favor of `rn_v3_flash`.


- The artifacts were moved to Coldlines storage.




Action:

You should update your config to use `rn_v3_flash` (C-Index +0.05).


Link: `atlas://registry/rn_v3_flash`





Why this is "Feature Set Zero"
Before a scientist canTrain(Factory) orEvaluate(Scorecard), they mustUnderstand.

    ● Onboarding:Reduces "Time to First PR" from weeksto days.
     ● Deflection:Answers L1 support questions ("Where isX?") without pinging senior
           engineers.
      ● Consistency:Ensures everyone uses thecurrentpatterns(`hypernexus-cli`) rather than
            copied legacy scripts.

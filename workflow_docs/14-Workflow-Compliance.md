# Workflow: The Compliance & Release Audit

[← Back to Index](00-Index.md)

**Role:** Lead Scientist / MLOps Engineer
**Goal:** Promote a research model to the Inferno production environment.

## Phase 1: The Governance Check ("The Gatekeeper")

**Context:** Before a model can be deployed, it must pass a strict audit:
1.  **PII Check:** Does the training data contain Personally Identifiable Information?
2.  **IP Check:** Are the code repos compliant (License Headers)?
3.  **Performance Gate:** Is it strictly better than the current production model?

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Run `ofm ip check` manually on the repo.
*   Check the TDM documentation to see if the dataset was PII-scrubbed.
*   Manually compare Excel sheets of metrics.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Run a pre-deployment audit.
**Action:** GREMLIN crawls the lineage graph in Atlas. It checks the "Upstream Datasets" for PII tags and runs the `tempathy` compliance tools on the source code.

```text
gremlin > Audit model 'cl_unimodal_v2' for production release.

📋 AUDIT REPORT: cl_unimodal_v2

1. Data Lineage:
   - Source: mm_fusion_v1 (Derived from: mm_curated_q225)
   - PII Status: ✅ Scrubbed (Certified by `text_anchor_date_redaction`)
   - License: ✅ Internal-Only

2. Code Compliance:
   - Repo: `ofm-late-fusion` (commit: a8f92b)
   - IP Headers: ✅ Present in all files
   - Security Scan: ✅ Passed

3. Performance Gate:
   - Candidate C-Index: 0.71
   - Current Prod C-Index: 0.69
   - Result: ✅ +0.02 Improvement

Status: 🟢 READY FOR PRODUCTION
```

## Phase 2: The Handover ("The Release")

**Context:** Generate the artifacts needed for the engineering team (SREs) to deploy this.

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Write a "Model Card" markdown file manually.
*   Copy/paste the S3 paths to the weights.
*   Email the SRE team.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Generate the release package.
**Action:** GREMLIN creates a standardized Model Card in Atlas, tags the artifacts as `production-candidate`, and notifies the `#deployments` Slack channel.

```text
gremlin > Tag as production-candidate and generate Model Card.

[LOG] Tagging Atlas Artifacts... [DONE]
[LOG] Generating Model Card (Markdown)... [DONE]
Created: docs/model_cards/cl_unimodal_v2.md

[LOG] Notification sent to #deployments via Slack.
The model is ready for Inferno ingestion.
```

## Phase 3: Model Card Deep Dive

**Context:** Regulatory and scientific rigor require comprehensive documentation. The Model Card is the "birth certificate" of the model.

### Generated Model Card Structure

GREMLIN auto-generates Model Cards following the Tempus standard format:

```markdown
# Model Card: cl_unimodal_v2

## Overview
| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Model Name | cl_unimodal_v2 |
| Version | 1.0.0 |
| Task | Overall Survival Prediction |
| Modality | Clinical Features Only |
| Architecture | Transformer Encoder (6L, 512d) |

## Training Data
| Dataset | Patients | Date Range | PII Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| mm_fusion_v1 | 1,120 | 2018-2024 | ✅ Scrubbed |

Data Products Used:
- clinical_molecular_v2 (DPL: dp://clinical/molecular/v2)

## Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value | 95% CI | vs. Baseline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C-Index | 0.71 | [0.68, 0.74] | +0.02 |
| Hazard Ratio | 1.52 | [1.21, 1.89] | Significant |

## Limitations & Bias
- **Population:** Trained on US patients; may not generalize globally
- **Temporal:** Data ends Q2 2024; treatment landscape may evolve
- **Missing Data:** 18% of cohort excluded due to incomplete regimen data

## Approval Chain
| Role | Name | Date | Status |

| Model Owner | J. Smith | 2024-12-01 | ✅ Approved |
| Data Steward | M. Chen | 2024-12-01 | ✅ Approved |

## Compliance Checklist

GREMLIN verifies all items before allowing production deployment:

| Check | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PII Scrubbed** | Training data has no PHI/PII | Auto-verified via TDM |
| **IP Compliant** | All source repos have license headers | `tempathy` scan |
| **Performance Gate** | Beats current production model | `ofm-bench` comparison |
| **Lineage Complete** | Full data → model → artifact chain | Atlas graph query |
| **Model Card Generated** | Documentation meets Tempus standard | Auto-generated |
| **Bias Analysis** | Subgroup performance checked | Residual analysis |
| **Leakage Verified** | No train/test contamination | Patient ID audit |

All checks must pass (🟢) before GREMLIN will enable the `Deploy to Inferno` action.

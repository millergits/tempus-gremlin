# Workflow: Data Products Integration

[← Back to Index](00-Index.md)

**Role:** Data Scientist / Modeling Scientist
**Goal:** Transition from ad-hoc CSV/Parquet files to immutable, versioned Data Products for reproducible ML experiments.

## Why Data Products Matter for ML

The current "Raw Ingredients" workflow (`ofm-data` buckets, manual CSV exports) creates reproducibility problems:

*   **Version Drift:** The same cohort query run today vs. 3 months ago returns different patients.
*   **No Lineage:** When a model fails in production, tracing back to the exact training data is manual detective work.
*   **Access Chaos:** Scientists share GCS paths via Slack; no audit trail of who accessed what.

**Tempus Data Products** solve this by providing:
*   **Immutability:** Once created, a Data Product file never changes.
*   **Versioning:** Schema changes create new versions; old versions remain accessible.
*   **Policy:** Access is controlled via the Data Products Service (DPS), not ad-hoc IAM.

## Phase 1: Discovery ("What's in the Pantry?")

**Context:** A scientist wants to find all available clinical + molecular cohorts for NSCLC.

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Scan internal wikis for dataset names.
*   Ask on Slack: "Does anyone have the Q2 NSCLC cohort?"
*   Hope the GCS path still exists and hasn't been overwritten.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Search the Data Products Library.
**Action:** GREMLIN queries the DPL catalog via BigQuery and returns matching Types.

## Phase 2: Access ("Check Out the Ingredients")

**Context:** The scientist has identified the Data Products they need. Now they want to join them for model training.

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Request access via ServiceNow ticket (2-5 day turnaround).
*   Once approved, manually copy files from GCS to local environment.
*   Write custom join logic to combine clinical + molecular data.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Request access and preview the join.
**Action:** GREMLIN checks current permissions, initiates access requests if needed, and generates the join query.

````text
gremlin > I need to join clinical_nsclc_outcomes with rna_expression_nsclc for patients with 1L data.

[LOG] Checking permissions...
✅ clinical_nsclc_outcomes: QUERY access granted
⚠️  rna_expression_nsclc: No access. Initiating request...

[LOG] Access request submitted to data-products-team@tempus.com
Request ID: DPS-REQ-2024-1847
Expected turnaround: 24-48 hours

Meanwhile, here's the join query you'll use once approved:

```sql
SELECT
  c.patient_id,
  c.os_months,
  c.os_event,
  c.1l_tot_days,
  r.gene_expression_vector
FROM `tempus-prod.dpl.clinical_nsclc_outcomes` c
JOIN `tempus-prod.dpl.rna_expression_nsclc` r
  ON c.patient_id = r.patient_id
WHERE c.line_of_therapy = 1
  AND c.1l_tot_days IS NOT NULL
```

Bookmark this query. I'll notify you when access is granted.

## Phase 3: Pin & Version ("Seal the Jar")

**Context:** The scientist has their cohort. Before training, they need to create an immutable snapshot so future runs use the exact same data.

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Export query results to a new GCS path.
*   Hope nobody overwrites it.
*   Manually document the query and date in a README.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Create a pinned dataset version.
**Action:** GREMLIN materializes the query result as a new Data Product, registering it in Atlas with full lineage.

````text
gremlin > Pin this cohort as 'nsclc_fusion_train_v1' for my experiment.

[LOG] Executing cohort query... [DONE]
[LOG] Result: 4,892 patients with complete 1L TOT + RNA data.

[LOG] Creating Data Product...
  Type: ml_training_cohort (internal)
  Version: v1.0.0

[LOG] Registering in Atlas...
  Dataset URI: atlas://datasets/nsclc_fusion_train_v1
  Lineage:
    └─ clinical_nsclc_outcomes@v3.2.1 (12,450 → 4,892 pts)
    └─ rna_expression_nsclc@v1.4.2 (6,890 → 4,892 pts)

✅ Dataset pinned: atlas://datasets/nsclc_fusion_train_v1
   SHA256: a7f3e9c2...
   Immutable: Yes
   Expires: Never (manual deletion only)

This dataset is now safe to reference in your experiment config.

## Phase 4: Audit ("Where Did This Come From?")

**Context:** Six months later, a model trained on this data shows unexpected behavior in production. The scientist needs to trace back to the exact training data.

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Search Slack history for the original GCS path.
*   Hope the scientist who created it is still at the company.
*   Manually reconstruct the query from code comments.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Trace the lineage.
**Action:** GREMLIN queries Atlas for the full provenance graph.

````text

🔍 POTENTIAL ISSUE DETECTED:
The RNA data used was v1.4.2, which has since been deprecated.
Consider retraining on v1.5.0 if gene expression is driving predictions.

Action: Compare model performance on v1.4.2 vs v1.5.0 cohorts?

## Phase 5: Self-Service Replication ("Debug in Lower Environments")

**Context:** A scientist needs production data in a lower environment (BET/VAL) to debug an issue.

### 🛑 The Old Way
*   Submit ServiceNow ticket with business justification.
*   Wait for manual approval and data copy.
*   Data expires; repeat the process.

### 👾 The GREMLIN Way
**Command:** Replicate to lower environment.
**Action:** GREMLIN wraps the `dps replication` CLI command with proper justification.

````text
gremlin > I need the clinical_nsclc_outcomes data in VAL to debug the missing patient issue.

[LOG] Checking replication eligibility...
✅ clinical_nsclc_outcomes: GCS-backed, managed Data Product
✅ Target environment: VAL (allowed)

## DPS CLI Reference (What GREMLIN Wraps)

GREMLIN provides natural language access to the Data Products CLI (`dps`). Here's what's happening under the hood:

| GREMLIN Command | DPS CLI Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Find Data Products for NSCLC" | `dps search --query "NSCLC"` |
| "Download the clinical outcomes file" | `dps download --product-id <id>` |
| "Describe the schema for X" | `dps search --product-id <id> --verbose` |
| "Replicate X to VAL" | `dps --env PRD replication --destination-env VAL --data-product-ids <id>` |

### Available CLI Commands

```bash
# Search for Data Products
dps search --help

# Download a single file
dps download --help

# Upload a new Data Product
dps upload --help

# Replicate to lower environment
dps replication --help

# Enable verbose logging for debugging
dps --verbose <command>
```

### Environment Support

| Environment | Access | Replication Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PRD | Production data | Source only |
| VAL | Validation environment | Yes (from PRD) |
| BET | Beta environment | Yes (Internal/Public only) |

## GREMLIN + Data Products: The Bridge

GREMLIN doesn't replace the Data Products platform—it makes it **accessible**.

| Without GREMLIN | With GREMLIN |
| :--- | :--- |
| Navigate Core Platform Console UI | Natural language search |
| Write raw BigQuery SQL | Auto-generated, validated queries |
| Manual ServiceNow tickets | Automated access requests |
| Copy-paste GCS paths | Pinned Atlas URIs with lineage |
| README.md documentation | Queryable provenance graph |
| `dps` CLI commands | Plain English requests |

The Data Products platform provides the **infrastructure**. GREMLIN provides the **interface**.
